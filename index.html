						The internet is a global network of computers that are
						interconnected to send and receive data simultaneously.
						Computers communicate with each other over the internet
						using various networking structures, by being linked
						either physically using cables or wires, or wirelessly
						through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi systems. Commonly described as
						a network of networks, the internet can establish
						connections between not just two computers but billions
						of computers all over the world.
					</p>
					<p>
						When data gets sent over the Internet, it is first
						broken up into smaller packets, which are then
						translated into bits. A packet is a smaller fragment of
						a larger message. The packets get routed to their
						destination by various networking devices such as
						routers and switches. When the packets arrive at their
						destination, the receiving device reassembles the
						packets in order and can then use or display the data.
						This process is called packet switching.

					<header>The Role Of HTTP In The Internet</header>
					<p>
						Protocols in networking refer to the rules that manage,
						control and make it possible for computers to
						communicate over the internet.The Hypertext Transfer
						Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web,
						and is used to load webpages using hypertext links. HTTP
						is an application layer protocol designed to transfer
						information between networked devices and runs on top of
						other layers of the network protocol stack. A typical
						flow over HTTP involves a client machine making a
						request to a server, which then sends a response
						message.
					</p>

					<header>Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS</header>
					<p>
						Authentication means verifying that a person or machine
						is who they claim to be. In HTTP, there is no
						verification of identity – it's based on a principle of
						trust. The architects of HTTP didn't necessarily make a
						decision to implicitly trust all web servers; they
						simply had priorities other than security at the time.
						But on the modern Internet, authentication is essential.
					</p>
					<p>
						The S in HTTPS stands for "secure." HTTPS uses TLS (or
						SSL) to encrypt HTTP requests and responses, so in the
						example above, instead of the text, an attacker would
						see a bunch of seemingly random characters. Instead of:
					</p>
					<code
						>GET /hello.txt HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: curl/7.63.0
						libcurl/7.63.0 OpenSSL/1.1.l zlib/1.2.11 Host:
						www.example.com Accept-Language: en</code
					>
					<p>The attacker sees something like:</p>
					<code>
						t8Fw6T8UV81pQfyhDkhebbz7+oiwldr1j2gHBB3L3RFTRsQCpaSnSBZ78Vme+DpDVJPvZdZUZHpzbbcqmSW1+3xXGsERHg9YDmpYk0VVDiRvw1H5miNieJeJ/FNUjgH0BmVRWII6+T4MnDwmCMZUI/orxP3HGwYCSIvyzS3MpmmSe4iaWKCOHQ==</code

				>
					<header>HTTP request and response cycle</header>
					<p>
						HTTP requests are generated by a user's browser as the
						user interacts with web properties. For example, if a
						user clicks on a hyperlink, the browser will send a
						series of "HTTP GET" requests for the content that
						appears on that page. If someone Googles "What is HTTP?"
						and this article shows up in the search results, when
						they click on the link, their browser will create and
						send a series of HTTP requests in order to get the
						information necessary to render the page.
					</p>
					<p>
						These HTTP requests all go to either an origin server or
						a proxy caching server, and that server will generate an
						HTTP response. HTTP responses are answers to HTTP
						requests.
					</p>
					<p>A GET request might look like this:</p>
					<code
						>GET /hello.txt HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: curl/7.63.0
						libcurl/7.63.0 OpenSSL/1.1.l zlib/1.2.11 Host:
						www.example.com Accept-Language: en</code
					>
					<p>
						This section of text, generated by the user's browser,
						gets sent across the Internet. The problem is, it's sent
						just like this, in plaintext that anyone monitoring the
						connection can read. (Those who are unfamiliar with the
						HTTP protocol may find this text hard to understand, but
						anyone with a baseline knowledge of the protocol's
						commands and syntax can read it easily.)
					</p>
					<p>
						This is especially an issue when users submit sensitive
						data via a website or a web application. This could be a
						password, a credit card number, or any other data
						entered into a form, and in HTTP all this data is sent
						in plaintext for anyone to read. (When a user submits a
						form, the browser translates this into an HTTP POST
						request instead of an HTTP GET request.)
					</p>
					<p>
						When an origin server receives an HTTP request, it sends
						an HTTP response, which is similar:
					</p>
					<code
						>HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Wed, 30 Jan 2019 12:14:39 GMT
						Server: Apache Last-Modified: Mon, 28 Jan 2019 11:17:01
						GMT Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 12 Vary:
						Accept-Encoding Content-Type: text/plain
						<span class="content">Hello World!</span>
					</code>
					<p>
						If a website uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, all requests
						and responses can be read by anyone who is monitoring
						the session. Essentially, a malicious actor can just
						read the text in the request or the response and know
						exactly what information someone is asking for, sending,
						or receiving.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="Common_HTTP_Methods" class="main-section">
					<header>Common HTTP Methods</header>
					<p>
						An HTTP method, sometimes referred to as an HTTP verb,
						indicates the action that the HTTP request expects from
						the queried server. For example, two of the most common
						HTTP methods are ‘GET’ and ‘POST’; a ‘GET’ request
						expects information back in return (usually in the form
						of a website), while a ‘POST’ request typically
						indicates that the client is submitting information to
						the web server (such as form information, e.g. a
						submitted username and password).
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							GET
							<br />The GET method requests a representation of
							the specified resource. Requests using GET should
							only retrieve data and should not contain a request
							content.
						</li>
						<li>
							HEAD The HEAD method asks for a response identical
							to a GET request, but without a response body.
						</li>
						<li>
							POST The POST method submits an entity to the
							specified resource, often causing a change in state
							or side effects on the server.
						</li>
						<li>
							PUT The PUT method replaces all current
							representations of the target resource with the
							request content.
						</li>
						<li>
							DELETE The DELETE method deletes the specified
							resource.
						</li>
						<li>
							CONNECT The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to
							the server identified by the target resource.
						</li>
						<li>
							OPTIONS The OPTIONS method describes the
							communication options for the target resource.
						</li>
						<li>
							TRACE The TRACE method performs a message loop-back
							test along the path to the target resource.
						</li>
						<li>
							PATCH The PATCH method applies partial modifications
							to a resource.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<section id="IP_Address" class="main-section">
					<header>IP Address</header>
					<p>
						An IP(Internet Protocol) address is a number used to
						address each device on an IP network uniquely. With
						billions of people accessing the Internet every day,
						unique identifiers are necessary to keep track of who is
						doing what. The Internet Protocol solves this by
						assigning IP numbers to every device accessing the
						Internet.
					</p>
					<p>
						The system that orchestrates all this is called DNS. It
						works like a phone book for IP addresses so that users
						can access web services using human-friendly domain
						names. When a user types a domain name like
						‘facebook.com’ into their browser window, this begins a
						DNS query which ultimately leads to a DNS server
						translating the domain name into an IP address.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="How_DNS_Works" class="main-section">
					<header>How DNS Works</header>
					<p>
						Humans access information online through domain names,
						like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact
						through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates
						domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load
						Internet resources.
					</p>
					<p>
						The process of DNS resolution involves converting a
						hostname (such as www.example.com) into a
						computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). An
						IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and
						that address is necessary to find the appropriate
						Internet device - like a street address is used to find
						a particular home. When a user wants to load a webpage,
						a translation must occur between what a user types into
						their web browser (example.com) and the machine-friendly
						address necessary to locate the example.com webpage.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="Types_Of_DNS_Records" class="main-section">
					<header>Types Of DNS Records</header>
					<p>
						DNS records (aka zone files) are instructions that live
						in authoritative DNS servers and provide information
						about a domain including what IP address is associated
						with that domain and how to handle requests for that
						domain. These records consist of a series of text files
						written in what is known as DNS syntax. DNS syntax is
						just a string of characters used as commands that tell
						the DNS server what to do. All DNS records also have a
						‘TTL’, which stands for time-to-live, and indicates how
						often a DNS server will refresh that record.
					</p>
					<p>Common types of DNS Records are</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							A record - The record that holds the IP address of a
							domain. Learn more about the A record.
						</li>
						<li>
							AAAA record - The record that contains the IPv6
							address for a domain (as opposed to A records, which
							list the IPv4 address). Learn more about the AAAA
							record.
						</li>
						<li>
							CNAME record - Forwards one domain or subdomain to
							another domain, does NOT provide an IP address.
							Learn more about the CNAME record.
						</li>
						<li>
							MX record - Directs mail to an email server. Learn
							more about the MX record.
						</li>
						<li>
							TXT record - Lets an admin store text notes in the
							record. These records are often used for email
							security. Learn more about the TXT record.
						</li>
						<li>
							NS record - Stores the name server for a DNS entry.
							Learn more about the NS record.
						</li>
						<li>
							SOA record - Stores admin information about a
							domain. Learn more about the SOA record.
						</li>
						<li>
							SRV record - Specifies a port for specific services.
							Learn more about the SRV record.
						</li>
						<li>
							PTR record - Provides a domain name in
							reverse-lookups. Learn more about the PTR record.
						</li>
